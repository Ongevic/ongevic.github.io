This project combines field data, satellite imagery, and machine learning approaches to improve yield predictions under changing climate conditions.\nKey Achievements: - Calibrated DSSAT models for maize and sorghum in Kenya - Developed early warning system for drought risk - Published 3 peer-reviewed papers\nTechnologies: R, Python, DSSAT, Google Earth Engine, QGIS\n\n\n\n\nDuration: 2023 - Present\nInstitution: University of Copenhagen (Collaboration)\nLocation: Viborg, Denmark\nInvestigating heat stress impacts on olive and grape production systems in the Mediterranean region using controlled environment studies and field experiments.\nKey Achievements: - Established temperature-yield response curves - Identified critical growth stages for heat sensitivity - Developed adaptation strategies for farmers\nTechnologies: Growth chambers, Data loggers, Statistical modeling\n\n\n\n\nDuration: 2021 - 2022\nInstitution: IUSS Pavia\nCreated a web-based platform for visualizing climate risks to agriculture at regional scales. The platform integrates multiple data sources to provide actionable insights for farmers and policymakers.\nKey Achievements: - Interactive web dashboard with 10+ risk indicators - User-friendly interface for non-technical stakeholders - Adopted by 3 regional agricultural agencies\nTechnologies: JavaScript, D3.js, PostgreSQL, Python Flask"
