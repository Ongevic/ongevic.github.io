## Current Projects

### üåæ Climate-Resilient Crop Modeling for Smallholder Farmers
**Duration**: 2022 - Present  
**Institution**: IUSS Pavia  
**Funding**: EU Horizon 2020

Developing integrated crop models to assess climate change impacts on smallholder farming systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. This project combines field data, satellite imagery, and machine learning approaches to improve yield predictions under changing climate conditions.

**Key Achievements**:
- Calibrated DSSAT models for maize and sorghum in Kenya
- Developed early warning system for drought risk
- Published 3 peer-reviewed papers

**Technologies**: R, Python, DSSAT, Google Earth Engine, QGIS

### üå°Ô∏è Temperature Stress Assessment in Mediterranean Crops
**Duration**: 2023 - Present  
**Institution**: University of Copenhagen (Collaboration)  
**Location**: Viborg, Denmark

Investigating heat stress impacts on olive and grape production systems in the Mediterranean region using controlled environment studies and field experiments.

**Key Achievements**:
- Established temperature-yield response curves
- Identified critical growth stages for heat sensitivity
- Developed adaptation strategies for farmers

**Technologies**: Growth chambers, Data loggers, Statistical modeling

### üìä Agricultural Risk Mapping Platform
**Duration**: 2021 - 2022  
**Institution**: IUSS Pavia  

Created a web-based platform for visualizing climate risks to agriculture at regional scales. The platform integrates multiple data sources to provide actionable insights for farmers and policymakers.

**Key Achievements**:
- Interactive web dashboard with 10+ risk indicators
- User-friendly interface for non-technical stakeholders
- Adopted by 3 regional agricultural agencies

**Technologies**: JavaScript, D3.js, PostgreSQL, Python Flask
